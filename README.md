# covidapp
our submission to duckhacks covid hackathon


# Inspiration
Kevin and I were inspired to make the app because we felt there was a real lack of an all around coronavirus support app for everyone.

# What it does
This app provides a symptom checklist, with information straight from the CDC health guidelines on coronavirus. It also provides a real time chat room for anyone to talk just about anything coronavirus, from symptoms, to emotional support, to just everyday quarantine life.

# How we built it
Android Studio, Java, and XML were all key components in the development of the app. Flutter was considered but would be too much a learning curve for a weekend project.

# Challenges we ran into
Google Maps has a very complicated setup and many of Google's APIs for places and maps are becoming deprecated due to AndroidX.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Live chat working just as we intended

# What we learned
How to work with Cloud Firestore efficiently and how to query live updates from the Firestore.

# What's next for COVID Checklist
A more in depth Google maps implementation, more live chat features, a much more detailed checklist and guideline sheet from the CDC
